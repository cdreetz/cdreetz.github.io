## What do I do?
I like to work with data and learn about data based skills and tools.  Currently focused on language modeling and application development around custom conversational tools.




## Skills acquired over time and applied during projects or work

- <b>Programs and Languages</b> Python, R, SAS, SPSS, SQL
- <b>Packages</b> Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Selenium, Ggplot, Caret, Tidyverse
- <b>DS Concepts </b> Linear/logistic regression, time series
- <b>DA Concepts </b> Data preprocessing, missing values, repeated values, converting variable types, column/row subsetting, visualizations
- <b>DA Tools </b> Automated data collection via webdriver
- <b> ML Tools</b> TensorFlow, PyTorch, Lightning, Weights and Biases
- <b> NLP/LLM Tools</b> HuggingFace Transformers, Mosaic Composer, Langchain
- <b> NLP/LLM Concepts</b> Sentiment Analysis, Conversational Agents, Agent Tools, Custom Bots
- <b> CV Concepts</b> Object detection, object classification, object tracking


## Skills in progress

- <b> ML Concepts</b> Production ML data pipeline

## Work experience

<b> Business Intelligence Developer - iGrad </b>
- Complete end to end data projects with Python, from data acquisition, preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and developing tools with both custom and pretrained models
- Deployed open source NLP machine learning models to create systems for projects including sentiment analysis and machine translation
- Query from our datawarehouse or othe data sources with SQL/TSQL/KQL
- Employ Azure products including Azure Data Factory, Pipelines, Cognitive Services, and Azure OpenAI
- Utlize Microsoft Power BI for creating reports and dashboards to present key data and analysis

## Open source

- <b> HuggingFace </b> - Contribute needed documentation additions and fixes.  As well as contribute key datasets for common tasks, and add new models to the Hub
- <b> Flyte </b> - Worked alongside key maintainers at SciPy 2023 Conference Sprint Days.  Contributed a new plugin by integrating the model analyzing feature of Weight Watchers into the Flyte platform.


## Recent project work
(July 2023) Over the past few months I have focused on developing LLM based tools both for myself while exploring developing for broad use.  I have also spend some time on widening my ML skills which meant doing some CV learning and projects.  One project consisted of a self driving challenge where I trained a model to predict the pitch and yaw of the camera of an unlabeled video.  Another was a project that consisted of a hand tracking tool where using my laptops camera I could show my hand and 20 different points of my hand were tracked and labeled.  I also trained a 120M parameter GPT-2 model with A100s hosted by Lambda Labs which cost $20 and 20 hours to train (A100's on Lambda are about $1.10 an hour)


(Feb 2023) The most recent work I have been doing is from my UsefulScore repository.  Initirally it was an attempt to learn and apply NLP methods, specifically with Python's Spacy package.  Over time it became more of a learning experience for me on using Selenium, on object oriented code, on HTML/CSS and XPATH direction, and on how to best organize a Github repository for a end to end data pipeline that creates a usable interface from the scraped data.
