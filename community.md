## Teaching

- <b>Non Data Graduate Students</b> Over time I have met or know several people who ended up in their MS programs at UTSA and when it came to conducting analysis for their thesis work, where they were instructed to use R, end up lost because they have never been exposed to using R.  


## Community Groups

- <b>San Antonio Data Science SA-DS</b> While lacking structure, I am actively reaching out to and looking for more data focused individuals who are interested in connecting.  Eventually planning to get everyone in some sort of structured group so everyone can connect with eachother, but it's a work in progress.
- <b>SA-DS Meetups</b> Inspiration came from the "Pracitcal Data Science Workshop" hosted by Mike Hindes at the Capital Factory building in Austin, TX.  The idea is for data individuals to be able to get together once a month and just get to do what they like to do, together.  Workshop topics can be anything from exploratory analysis with a provided dataset, creating a dataset from a provided source, or modeling supplied data for predicting.  The SA-DS Meetups will be less workshop focused and more open to general discussions and sharing.  The SA-DS group will also be virtually linked to the Practical Data Science Workshop in Austin, where we will meet at the same time, in both cities, and get to collaborate on work as one big group.
