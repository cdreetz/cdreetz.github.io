## Recent project work

The most recent work I have been doing is from my UsefulScore repository.  Initirally it was an attempt to learn and apply NLP methods, specifically with Python's Spacy package.  Over time it became more of a learning experience for me on using Selenium, on object oriented code, on HTML/CSS and XPATH direction, and on how to best organize a Github repository for a end to end data pipeline that creates a usable interface from the scraped data.
